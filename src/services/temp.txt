API calls and backend interaction

array destructuring, way to get an in individual item from an array of items and save those individual components
as  separate components

let veggies = [onion, carrot]

const [v1, v2] = veggies;
console.log(v1) // onion

object destructuring, destructre using its exact property name as the destructured variable

useState hook use an array for return value
useState hook allows to work with state in components

side effect, makes a function impure, pure functions don't have side effects, impure functions do.

pure functions returns same output no matter how many times it invoked
impure functions have some external functions; console.log(), fetch

useEffect() hook used to handle impure actions, all impure actions should be inside a specific area
useEffect() run after React updated the DOM
if effect returns a function it will be executed when ever clean up needed, when component unmount
when useEffect dependency array is empty useEffect run only once, if it is not given it will run as many times

hooks rule
only call inside the react component functions
only call hooks at the top level of the component, call outside the loops, conditions and before return statement
call multiple state or effect hooks, hook calls outside the conditions
make multiple hook calls in the same sequence

fetch, make a server request to retrieve JSON data
fetchAPI a set of functions for fetch

single threaded execution, next step cannot be executed bfore the completion of current step
fetch() is fazzard function, it seems to be part of javascript  but it is a way to call webAPI from javascript
acces a browser functionality outside of javascript.

promise, an object returned by an asyncronous function which represnts the current state of an operation
at the time promise returned to the caller operation isn't finished but promise object provide methods
to handle the eventual success or failure of the operation

async, make a function asyncronous, place it before the function

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, intial state), reducer function return the new state, 
dispatch function takes action as the only argument,react send the state and action to reducer function
reducer function write as switch statement
useReducer is used when the state is complex and next state depends on previous state

const ref = useRef(0), return an object with one property current, inital value can be anything it is igonred after first render
changing ref property do trigger re-rendering, does not reset its value after re-render, information is 
local 

jsx, extension to javascript, react uses jsx to describe ui appearance
each node in the component tree is a plain javascript object/element that describ the component instance or dom node
an element is wat to describe final html output as plain output
each element consists 2 prperties, type and props, type describe what kind of element like button points toward the component,
props consists all objects the component receives.
element tree converts to dom elements, virtual dom, a javascript alternative representation of the real dom
ui changes, build a new element tree, compare it with previous tree, calculate difference in the tree 
using diff operation, based on the difference it make minimal changes to the underlaying dom nodes to process 
the updates

componet composition, containment and specialization
containment, fact that children are unknown ahead of time
for dialog boxes, pass children prop directly as the content, it will become generic conponent that accept
any valid jsx as children, containment feature
specialization, the component is a speacial case for another component, ComfirmationDialog comp is special case
comp of Dialog comp

React Fragment tag or <></> emptytag grouping children without adding extra nodes

React top level elements, used to manipulate and transform elements, 
ways of importing elements from react package

react.cloneElement effectively clone and return a new element of a provided element
cloneElement(element, [props]),props that to be added to the clone comp,
props are immutable ojects, using cloneElement operation performed on cloned element,
cloneElement used to modify and add properties, extend children functionality,

react.children provide utilities to work with props.children data structure

spread operator [...object/array/string]
copy, newvariable = {...originalvaraible}
merge, newvariable = {...originalvaraible, modifyproperty:value}, should happen inorder

higher order component enahance a component by providing new props to it
cross-cutting-concerns,hoc, higher order component, a function that takes a component 
as argument return a new component

const withSubscription = (WrappedComponent) => {
    return (props) => {
        return <WrappedComponent {...props}/>
    }

}
never mutate the hoc and pass unrelated props to the WrappedComponent

render props, take functions that return react elements, call them inside their render logic
enhance original component without modifying original component
way of injecting the new props is differs hoc,

const Comp = ({render}) => {

    const [data, setData] = useState({})

    return render(data)
}
render props is a functions that return some jsx
<Comp render = {(data) => <h1>data.property</h1>}

Comp does not take care of any visualization logic, it encapsulate cross-cutting concerns
return the result(data) of calling render function

test, avoid including implimentation details, work with dom nodes, resemsble software usage
jest and react testing library, tesing tools
jest, javascript test runner that allow acces to artificial dom, js dom, approximation of how browser works
features, mocking, ensure unit tesing standalone,
react tesing library, set of utilities, test component with out knowing implimentation

mock function, tracl a perticular function called by a external code

ci, continous integration, working on long feedback loop is risky, introducing new changes is time consuming
ci tool monitors the central code repository and prevents people from when and how to run the test
new commit accepted, if the all automated test cases passed.

continous interaction is a small part of continous delivery
when new commit, a new app will be built and set of test cases will be run on that

components are functions that take data or props as input return an element tree,
elements are plain javascript objects, offers a light weight representation of the dom,
cross-cutting concerns refers to the generic functionality that is not related to business logic
handling errors, authentication, fetching
